ckb-cloud
=========

Control your keyboard colours from the cloud!

This project aims to make it possible to control the key-colours of keyboards supported by [ckb-next](https://github.com/mattanger/ckb-next) from a network.
It can either be used from within a local network, or connected to a ckb-cloud instance running on a remote server.

This is mainly useful for notifying you of events via your keyboard's key colours (e.g. got a new Mail? Set _M_ to _red_!)

Note that this project is not intended to replace keyboard-wide effects like the colourful rainbow or ripple-effects, but only enables setting effects on single keys.
That way, functionality is clearly divided between ckb-next and ckb-cloud. ckb-cloud for notifications, ckb-next for anything else.
